//: ## Calculations
//: You can use a playground like a calculator. Type in the math problem you want solved and the results sidebar shows the answer, or the _result_, of the calculation.
//:
//: You can use the plus `+` and minus `-` signs for addition and subtraction, just as youâ€™d expect:
34 + 50 + 235

1000 - 50

23-4

//: For multiplication, use the asterisk `*` :
3 * 1000

30 * 6
//: For division, use the slash `/` :
24 / 6

100 / 2

50 / 50
//: For grouping, use parenthesis `( )` :
(300 + 1000 + 400) / 2

(56 + 7 * 24) / 3
//: - experiment:\
//: Practice using the playground like a calculator.
//: Edit some of the existing expressions and add a few of your own.
//: Notice that every time you make a change the results are updated in the sidebar.
//:
//: Next, learn how programmers can leave notes in code.
